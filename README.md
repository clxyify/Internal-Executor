# Internal-Executor

Replaces ImGUI with this classic **Internal Interface** written directly in Lua.

To run the Internal Executor with the Built-in execution function:
```lua
StartInternalExecutor("My Internal Executor")
```

To destroy the Internal Executor (or you can press X at the top right side):
```lua
DestroyInternalExecutor()
```
